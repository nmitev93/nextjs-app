## Next.js app with DynamoDB as storage

### Setup
If you are setting up the project for the first time, you can execute the `one_step_setup.sh` script,
which will create the necessary Docker containers, configure the database and 
install relevant Next.js project dependencies.

To start the project locally you can use the `start_project.sh` script, which will start the DynamoDB and run the Next.js app in dev mode.
